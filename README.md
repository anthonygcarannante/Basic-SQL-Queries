# Basic-SQL-Queries

This repo is to show my knowledge of SQL querying.
I created multiple queries to combine tables and display specific data between 6 tables in the SQL database.
Once that was complete, I converted the SQL tables to pandas dataframes in Jupyter notebook and looked at salary data of all of these employees.
This utilizes postgres as the SQL database and SQL Alchemy as the module to import the SQL data and create a connection from Jupyter to the postgreSQL database.
